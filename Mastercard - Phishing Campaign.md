## Task 1: Designing a phishing email 

The simulation starts with a quick review on phishing, then asks me to
improve a phishing email that could be used in a safety campaign.

The original email looked like this

This is what I believe an improved version of the email could look like:

## Task 2: Analyzing the results of a phishing email campaign

This part of the simulation assumes a phishing safety campaign already
took place, and now I am analyzing the results and putting together a
presentation to improve security awareness.

Analyzing the results of a phishing campaign can be something as simple
as counting the number of people who were reached and the number of
people who "fell for it". This can be used to identify the areas of the
business which need more training.

Then, I came up with a quick presentation about teaching the HR
department about phishing [linked

For the future, it would be better if I included more visuals such as
pictures of an example phishing email so that it's not just a bunch of
text that the employees have to look at.
